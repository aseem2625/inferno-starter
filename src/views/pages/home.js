				<h2>Dev Dashboard</h2>
				<p>With <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">`webpack-dashboard`</a>, it's much easier to see what's happening inside your bundles. In addition to de-cluttering your `webpack-dev-server` log, you can quickly make sense of your bundles' `import`s and sizes.</p>

				<img src="/img/dev-dash.jpg" />

				<p>The dashboard is meant to be interactive (scrollable). If you are having issues, please see the author's note:</p>
				<p>
					<blockquote>
						<strong>OSX Terminal.app users:</strong> Make sure that <strong>View â†’ Allow Mouse Reporting</strong> is enabled, otherwise scrolling through logs and modules won't work. If your version of Terminal.app doesn't have this feature, you may want to check out an alternative such as <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTerm2</a>.
