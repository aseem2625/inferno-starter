# inferno-starter

> Want to learn infernojs or kickstart your next application!  ðŸ”¥(SPA / SSR / PWA / Webpack, etc) ? <br /> Checkout the branches below:
- `master` - aim to make it ideal SSR with webpack2 [merger of all other branches]
- `ssr` - aim to have SSR converted from SPA. Will be removed once ssr is merged to master [WIP]
- `spa` - aim to have SPA with as much minimal footprint and best general standards and development practices (inferno, redux, router, webpack, frontend api middleware, logger middleware)
- `redux` - adds inferno-redux with component in SPA. Additionally added redux-thunk to show middleware usage. [feature branch]
- `lazyload` - adds code-splitting for lazy loading js components at route level in SPA. (plans to extend to css later) [feature branch]

**Check the commits of feature branches to see how the feature is added step by step.**

> :triangular_flag_on_post: **Contribute:** Inferno js has pretty less learning resources. With repos like this and others, it can provide a great learning resource or a ready-to-use boilerplate for the community. You'are very much welcome to contribute **features/enhancements** following the best practices. Please keep following things in mind before sending PRs.


> :triangular_flag_on_post: **Back Links:** Who doesn't want learning resources to be at one place. If you're using this repository, it would be great to send a PR (README.md) adding your repo link below:

**Please note:** 
- [Lukeed](https://github.com/lukeed/inferno-starter) originally made setup to have a build with all css in single .css file.
 Recently, I modified it to be CSS in JS way which goes really well with chunks. Layout specific css is put inside bundle css file and some in index.html
- Bootstrap or other css frameworks won't be added since I want to keep this repo as much minimalistic. Use traditional approach or [bootstrap-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap-loader) in case you want to try.
- I'll be creating small in-project css library for grids and all necessary things for style to keep overall size small by not including bootstrap, etc.

## Install

```sh
// check your node version before intallation (I'm using v7.7.3)
git clone https://github.com/aseem2625/inferno-starter.git
npm install
npm start
```

> :exclamation: **Pro Tip:** Use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install dependencies 3x faster than NPM!

## Features

### SPA
* Offline Caching (via `serviceWorker`) (there seems to be an [issue](https://github.com/lukeed/inferno-starter/issues/6). Yet to figure out and fix.)
* SASS & Autoprefixer
* Webpack Extract plugin for CSS
* Asset Versioning (aka "cache-busting")
* ES6 and ES7(with decorators) support
* Webpack Bundle Analysis (see [dashboard](#dashboard))
* Hot Module Re-loading for CSS and Live-reloading for JS(inferno doesn't support hot-reloading for js)
* inferno-devtool to make use of chrome plugin for React dev tools
* Code splitting for lazy loading JS modules
* Async data fetch (TBD)
* Work on CSS side for performance. See if chunking is good. Ensure that this doesn't flicker very first load. (TBD)
* Add just necessary css style in-project library
* [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) Initial repo from [Lukeed](https://github.com/lukeed/inferno-starter) was 100/100 Lighthouse certified. I'm yet to verify again after my modifications

### SSR (WIP)
* This is above SPA extended to SSR (all possible features from above)
* Express Server for server side rendering (TBD)
* async data fetching technique and feed for initial state (TBD)
* caching pages for server load-optimization. There are many techniqes and controls, however only a simplr LRU approach to cache route level components will be used for now.(TBD)
* Dynamically disable server side rendering based on server load (TBD, may not add this)
* convert .html to .ejs or .hbs for better control (TBD)
* sanitze html (TBD)
* Proxy the api requests to different server (TBD)
* Segregate reducers also in lazy loading (TBD) Reference: [Davezuko-react](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/blob/master/src/store/reducers.js)
* security checks (TBD) Reference: [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet), [express(helmet)](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html)

### Improvements (TBD)
* Add redux-logger
* Separate api layer on frontend (probably using fetch as it's tending to become non-jquery standard and will be helpful in SSR as well)
* Check support for preload, prefetch etc. (can be done for smaller website. It's done at html plugin level)
* Change header based on route. SEO related support, like custom twitter/facebook meta-data
* Add robots.txt
* Support for fonts, etc
* Special care for caching. Since files served would be having unique chunk hash. It makes sense to put cache max-life to be a large no.
* What's a PWA boilerplate without showing above/below-the-fold example (Use component specific chunking with es6 import way)

## Development

### Commands

Any of the following commands can (and should :wink:) be run from the command line.

> If using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), all instances of `npm` can be replaced with `yarn`. :ok_hand:

#### build

```
$ npm run build
```

Compiles all files. Output is sent to the `dist` directory.

#### start

```
$ npm start
```

Runs your application (from the `dist` directory) in the browser.

#### watch

```
$ npm run watch
```

Like [`start`](#start), but will auto-compile & auto-reload the server after any file changes within the `src` directory.

### Dashboard

With [`webpack-dashboard`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard), it's much easier to see what's happening inside your bundles. In addition to de-cluttering your `webpack-dev-server` log, you can quickly make sense of your bundles' `import`s and sizes.

![dashboard](src/static/img/dev-dash.jpg)

The dashboard is meant to be interactive (scrollable). If you are having issues, please see the author's note:

> ***OS X Terminal.app users:*** Make sure that **View â†’ Allow Mouse Reporting** is enabled, otherwise scrolling through logs and modules won't work. If your version of Terminal.app doesn't have this feature, you may want to check out an alternative such as [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/index.html).
